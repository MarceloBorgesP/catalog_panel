# Catalog panel

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MarceloBorgesP/catalog_panel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MarceloBorgesP/catalog_panel)

This is a project created for [Eduk](http://www.eduk.com.br/), as a challenge for front-end skills.

## About

The catalog panel is a single page application created with ember, that gets data from a json and uses it as fixtures to simulate a database. To create these fixtures we are using [ember-cli-mirage](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/).

Eduk already has this catalog on its website, so I decided to create a project that follows its theme, but makes some minor improvements, the most important one being that i am using bootstrap for everything, what makes it easier to deal with the responsibility (some components in eduk's website don't take advantage of bootstrap).

The code couldn't be fully tested because of the time, but I tried to insert integration and unit tests.

## Cross-browser Compatibility

The app was tested with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox and is working great :)
